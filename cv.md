*Hello, as you can read in my resume, I am not the most suitable candidate for the role of an IT specialist, but this is only the first opinion. I am very easy to learn and I love to comprehend   new sciences. I studied to be an ecologist and worked as a charity worker. I learned accounting myself, and worked for one of the leading companies in construction, doing all the stages of working with documents. I was able to write a diploma in model photography in a month and win at a city exhibition, without photography experience. I overcame the fear of driving a car by becoming a racing driver and forging a racing track. All this suggests that I am not afraid to study and am ready to work hard. Mathematical mindset and diligence will help me in this. I am already learning languages and am very interested in developing my IT skills. I am ready to accept any challenge and prove that I am a reliable specialist. Are you ready?*
